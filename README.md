*Scott Kerman watched as the enormous wedge-shaped space plane, known as the Mk-33, began launch preparations. Unlike previous generations of rockets, the Mk-33 needed no lengthy preflight checks. Just perform a quick visual inspection, run diagnostics, load a new payload, roll it out to the pad, rotate it vertical, fuel, and launch. At the end of its mission, land at the launch site runway and repeat. It would change everything. It just needed a name… “Skyranger,” Scott thought aloud…*

The X-33 was a sub-orbital technology demonstrator for the larger Lockheed Martin VentureStar single-stage-to-orbit reusable launch vehicle. It was created with the goal of significantly reducing the cost of sending payloads to orbit and to approach airline-like turnaround times between launches. Unfortunately, the X-33 was cancelled in 2001, but this specialized parts kit lets you build a similar craft for KSP. Features include:

•	Parts to make your own X-33 inspired (NOT a replica) SSTO or something more kerbal.

•	Optimized for JNSQ but works fine in stock scale- just empty the forward and aft tanks for stock scale.

•	Custom launchpad parts for immersive game play.

•	Requires no plugins or mods, but it can support DockRotate, KSP-DepthMask, Servo Controller, Snacks, Wild Blue Decals, Wild Blue Tools, and more.
