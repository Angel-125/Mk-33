	description = The Vernier 5-Way RCS Thruster is an attitude control thruster. These motors are linked to RCS controls, but are powered by a Fuel+Oxidizer mix, making them significantly more powerful than MonoPropellant-powered RCS thrusters. They are fairly more bulky in comparison though, although most agree that is an acceptable trade-off for the additional punch they pack.
